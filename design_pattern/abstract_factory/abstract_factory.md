# Abstract Factory Pattern

**Purpose:**  
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**When to Use:**  
- When the system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- When the system needs to be configured with one of multiple families of products.
- To enforce constraints about which objects can be used together.

## Study the Pattern Structure

**Abstract Factory Class:**  
Declares an interface for creating abstract product objects.

**Concrete Factory Class:**  
Implements the operations to create concrete product objects.

**Abstract Product Class:**  
Declares an interface for a type of product object.

**Concrete Product Class:**  
Defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory.

**Client:**  
Uses only interfaces declared by Abstract Factory and Abstract Product classes.

## Analyze the Pattern

**Benefits:**

- Ensures that families of related products are used together.
- Promotes consistency among products.
- Isolates concrete classes from the client.

**Drawbacks:**

- Can be challenging to support new kinds of products.
- Increases the complexity of the system due to the number of classes involved.

**Alternatives:**

- Factory Method Pattern: If only one product needs to be created, the Factory Method Pattern might be simpler.
- Prototype Pattern: If instances of the product class have only a few different states, the Prototype Pattern might be more efficient.
