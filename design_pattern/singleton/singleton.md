# Singleton Pattern

**Purpose:**  
Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

**When to Use:**  
When you need exactly one instance of a class to control the access to some shared resource (e.g., a configuration manager, a logger).

## Study the Pattern Structure

**Singleton Class:**  
Contains a static instance and a static method to provide access to that instance.

**Client:**  
Calls the static method to get the instance of the Singleton class.

## Analyze the Pattern

**Benefits:**

- Controlled access to the single instance.
- Lazy initialization: The instance is created only when needed.
- Thread safety: Ensures that only one instance is created even in a multi-threaded environment.

**Drawbacks:**

- Can be difficult to test due to the global state.
- Potential for misuse if used excessively.

**Alternatives:**

- Global objects or static class members can sometimes be simpler solutions.
- Other creational patterns like Factory or Builder might be more appropriate depending on the context.
