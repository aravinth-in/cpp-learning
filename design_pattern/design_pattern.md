Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

Types of Design Patterns
Creational Patterns: Deal with object creation mechanisms.
Examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

Structural Patterns: Deal with object composition.
Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.

Behavioral Patterns: Deal with object interaction and responsibilities.
Examples: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor.
