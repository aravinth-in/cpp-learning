# Coupling in Software Design

## Tight Coupling vs. Loose Coupling

### Tight Coupling

**Advantages:**
- **Performance:** Tight coupling can sometimes lead to better performance because components are designed to work closely together.
- **Simplicity:** It can be simpler to implement initially since components are directly connected.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Maintenance:** Changes in one component often require changes in another, making maintenance difficult.
- **Reusability:** Components are less reusable because they are dependent on each other.
- **Testing:** Unit testing is harder because components cannot be tested in isolation.

### Loose Coupling

**Advantages:**
- **Maintenance:** Easier to maintain because changes in one component do not heavily impact others.
- **Reusability:** Components are more reusable as they are designed to be independent.
- **Testing:** Easier to test components in isolation.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity:** Can be more complex to design and implement initially.
- **Performance:** May introduce some performance overhead due to the use of interfaces and abstraction layers.

## Strategies to Achieve Loose Coupling

1. Use Interfaces and Abstract Classes
2. Dependency Injection
3. Design Pattern
