## How to Compile and Run on macOS

To compile and execute the code on macOS, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your C++ source file.
3. Use the following command to compile your code:

    ```sh
    g++ -std=c++17 -o my_program filename.cpp
    ```

    Replace `my_program` with the desired name for your executable and `filename.cpp` with the name of your C++ source file.

4. Run the compiled program with:

    ```sh
    ./my_program
    ```

    Replace `my_program` with the name of your executable.
